# Node.js Async Ordering
A script for handling async requests in order.

The main functionality of this script is to take in multiple asynchronous calls and process them in the order which they were made.

To demonstrate, this takes any number of urls as command line arguments and grabs the html from the page, displaying them in the order they were input. This functionality is only for demonstrative purposes and in reality can be changed to handle any reponse processing in order.
